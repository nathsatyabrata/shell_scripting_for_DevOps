# if else condition

if [ $a > $b ]
then 
   echo "a is greater than b"

   echo "a is smaled than b"

# For Loop (iterations) - we have for, while, until & select loop in shell scripting.
-------------------------------------
for i in {1.100}; do echo $i; done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
write a shell script to print numbers divided by 3 & 5 and not 15 till 1 to 100.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Divisible by 3 (if condition).
Divisible by 5 (if condition).
And not divisible by 15 (Not if condition)
1..100 (for loop)
--------------------------------------------
for  i in {1..100}; do
if ([ `expr $i % 3` == 0 ] || [`expr $i % 5` == 0]) && [ `expr $i % % 15 != 0 ];
then 
   echo $i
fi;
done

-----------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..100}; do
  if { (( i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 )) && (( i % 15 != 0 )); } then
    echo $i
  fi
done

Write a shell-script to print number of "S" in mississippi
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
x=mississippi
grep -o "s" <<<"$x" | wc -l # (-o) refers to only, (wc) refers to word count in line, 

or 

#!/bin/bash

word="mississippi"
count=$(echo $word | grep -o "s" | wc -l)
echo "The number of 'S' in mississippi is: $count"

What is crontab in Linux ? can you provide an example of usage ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crontab is like a alarm. We can set some task in a script on a particular time to get some information from system.
For Example: node Health.

--------------------------------------------------------
What is the diffrence betwen soft link and hard link ?
--------------------------------------------------------
Hard Link:
-> Acts as an additional copy of the original file.
-> if the original file is deleted, the hard link still retains the data.
cmd: ln originalfile hardlink

Soft Link (Symbolic Link):
-> Acts as a shortcut or pointer to the original file’s name.
-> Does not contain the actual data but points to the file’s location, so if the original file is deleted, the soft link breaks.
-> ln -s originalfile softlink

In essence, hard links are like additional names for the same file content, while soft links are just pointers to file names

------------------------------------------------------------
What is the diffrence between break and continue statement ?
------------------------------------------------------------
Break - Breaking the execution
Continue - Continue the execution or can say Skip this and continue the next.

Example of Break: suppose we need to loop a big number, but if we got a perticular number then we can break the loop.
Example of Continue: Suppose we don't need a number in a loop then we can use continue, then this will skip that number then continue the loop.
------------------------------------------------
What are some disadvantage of Shell-Scripting ?
------------------------------------------------
-> Errors are frequent and costly, and a single error can alter the command.
-> The execution speed is slow.
-> Bugs or inadequacies in the language's syntax or implementation.\
-> Large, complex tasks aren't well suited to it.
-> Contray to other scripting languages, it provides a minimal data structure.
-> Every time shell command is executed a new process is lunched.
----------------------------------------------------
What are the diffrent type of loops in shell script?
----------------------------------------------------
We have 3 types of loop. 
1. for Loop
2. while Loop
3. until Loop
---------------------------------------------
Is bash dynamic or statically typed and why ?
---------------------------------------------
shell is dynamic language like python.
But golang or any muddernday language is static
-----------------------------------
Networking troubleshooting utility ?
-----------------------------------
traceroute googe.com - this will check the how many hope its using to reach google.com from my laptop.
tracepath also we can but work is same

How will you sort list of names in a file ?
-------------------------------------------
sort names.txt > sorted_names.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will you manage logs of a system that generate huge log files everyday ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to use logrotate. So we can setup a time zip the logfile after some time. Or we can delete the logfile after sometime.
